## What do your WhatsApp chats say?

This little project pulls data from a chat's .txt file - must be manually downloaded from WA - to produce the following metrics:

1. Total messages exchanged, and proportion of messages sent by each participant: table and (the blasphemous) pie chart
2. Proportion of messages sent by each participant by month (might indicate interest in conversation over time): area plot
3. Number of messages grouped by hour of day (line chart)
4. Number of messages grouped by day of week (bar chart)
5. Number of messages exchanged every day since beginning of chat (bar plot)
6. Total number of days since the first message, and the number of days on which not a single message was exchanged: print statement
7. Number of media files (photos/videos) sent by each participant: bar chart
8. Average length of messages by participant and by date: table for length by participant and bar chart for length by participant
9. Who sends the first message and how many times (the definition of "first message" is user-defined): table
10. Most common words used by each participant: (dictionary)
11. Most common emojis used by each participant: (dictionary)

I have included some sample charts from chats that I analysed in the "sample graphs" folder.

Goes without saying, a lot more can be done with the given code. For instance, you could add a short snippet of code to find how many times a particular word was used in a chat (regex should work for this purpose).

#### PS: Make sure to have your phone's timing in the 24-hour format before you download the chat files
